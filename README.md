i am assuming that most of the collusion issues are because of the usage of h1,h2,h3 futures 
and its box model.

one day once i get faster at this i'll come and fix it. 
but for now i am pleased with the final results xx

list of known issues:
-1st section not alligning with header once reduced 
-3rd section "-thor god of thunder" text not alligned with the end of quote 

probably both are because of the same thing lol
